      intended to compete with any existing guides to Oxford: it is not a
      guide-book in any formal or exhaustive sense. Its purpose is to shew forth
      the chief beauties of the University and City, as they have appeared to
      several artists; with such a running commentary as may explain the
      pictures, and may indicate whatever is most interesting in connection with
      the scenes which they represent. Slight as the notes are, there has been
      no sacrifice, it is believed, of accuracy. The principal facts have been
      derived from Alexander Chalmers' <i>History of the Colleges, Halls, and
      Public Buildings of the University of Oxford</i>, from Mr. Lang's <i>Oxford</i>,
      and from the <i>Oxford and its Colleges</i> of Mr. J. Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrations, with the exception of six only, which are derived from
      Ackermann's <i>Oxford</i>, are reproduced from the paintings of living
      artists, mostly by Mr. W. Matthison, the others by Mrs. C. R. Walton,
      Walter S. S. Tyrwhitt, Mr. Bayzant, and Miss E. S. Cheesewright.

    <h2>
      OLDEST OXFORD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>XFORD is so
      naturally associated with the idea of a University, and the Collegiate
      buildings which confront one at every turn have such an ancient
      appearance, that a stranger might be excused for thinking that the
      University is older than the town, and that the latter grew up as an
      adjunct to the former. Of course, the slightest examination of facts
      suffices to dissipate this notion. Oxford is a town of great antiquity,
      which may well have been in existence in Alfred the Great's time, though
      there is not a shred of documentary evidence to prove that he was, as
      tradition so long asserted, connected with the foundation of a university
      there: it certainly existed in the reign of his son and successor, Edward
      the Elder, because&mdash;and this is the earliest historical mention of
      the place&mdash;the English Chronicle tells us that Edward took
      "Lundenbyrg and Oxnaford and all the lands that were obedient thereto."
      That was in 912, a date which marks the first authenticated appearance of
      Oxford on the stage of English history. .
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a passage in Domesday Book which gives us a fair idea of the size
      of the town in the Conqueror's day. It contained over seven hundred houses,
      but of these, so harshly had the Normans treated the place, two-thirds
      were ruined and unable to pay taxes. William made Robert D'Oily, one of
      his followers, governor of Oxford. D'Oily's is the earliest hand (a heavy
      one, by the way, as the townsfolk learnt to their cost) whose impress is
      visible on the Oxford of to-day. We may indeed, if we please, attribute a
      certain piece of wall in the Cathedral to a remoter date, but the grim old
      tower (which appears in the first illustration) is the first building in
      Oxford whose author can with certainty be named. It is all that remains of
      the Castle which Robert D'Oily built in order to control the surrounding
      country; and he built his stronghold by the riverside because he thereby
      dominated the waterway, along which enemies were apt to come, as well as
      wide tracts of land in every direction. No doubt the hands of the
      conquered English laboured at the massive structure which was to keep them
      in subjection.

      A queen was once besieged in the castle, Matilda, Henry I.'s daughter.
      When food gave out she made her escape in a romantic manner, so the story
      tells. The river was frozen and the ground covered with snow. The queen
      was let down from the tower by night with ropes, clad in white, the better
      to escape observation. Three knights were with her, clad in white also,
      under whose guidance she reached Wallingford on foot, and so escaped King
      Stephen's clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the period of the Norman Conquest belongs also the tower of St.
      Michael's Church, in the Cornmarket. It has been usual to describe this
      edifice as Saxon; but antiquaries incline to think that if Robert D'Oily
      did not build St. Michael's tower, he at least repaired it. This tower
      formed a part of the city wall, and from its narrow windows arrows may
      have rained upon advancing foes. Adjoining it was Bocardo, the old
      north-gate of the city, whose upper chamber was long used as a prison.
      Nothing of Bocardo now remains; but Robert D'Oily's handiwork is
      traceable, as many think, in the crypt and chancel of St.
      Peter-in-the-East and in the chancel arch at Holywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these buildings, then, the history of Norman Oxford is written, so far
      as history can be written in stone; yet here and there about the city are
      to be seen structures which, although two or three centuries younger, have
      an appearance hardly less venerable. Year after year the aged walls and
      portals are thronged with fresh generations of the youth of England; and
      it is in this combination of youth and age that no little of the charm of
      Oxford lies. We speak within the limitations of mortality: but, could we
      escape them for a moment, "immortal age beside immortal youth" might be
      her most appropriate description.

    <h2>
      THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS BUILDINGS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN did the
      University come into existence? That is a question which many
      people would like to have answered, but which still, like Brutus, "pauses
      for a reply." It is to the last degree improbable that we shall ever know.
      There were teachers and learners in Oxford at an early date, but so there
      were in many other English towns; the plant struck deeper in Oxford than
      elsewhere, that is all that one can say. There are various indications
      that in the twelfth century the town had acquired a name for learning. In
      1186, Giraldus Cambrensis, who had written a book about Ireland and wanted
      to get it known, came and read his manuscript aloud at Oxford, where, as
      he tells us, "the clergy in England chiefly flourished and excelled in
      clerkly lore." That was fifty years after the death of King Henry the
      Scholar, who&mdash;was it only a coincidence?&mdash;had a residence in
      Oxford. It is pleasant to find Oxford students, even in those early days,
      with ears attuned to hearing "some new thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctors of the different faculties," we are told, were among Giraldus'
      auditors: a fact which shows that learning was already getting
      systematised. A little later it has clothed itself in corporate form, and
      possesses a Chancellor. That official (when, and by whom appointed, is the
      mystery) is first mentioned in 1214, and we can henceforth look upon the
      University as a living body. He is named in connection with the first
      recorded "town and gown" row, when the citizens of Oxford took two clerks
      and hung them. The papal Legate (this was in the evil days of King John)
      intervened, and the citizens were very properly rebuked and fined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A century passed before "The Gown" had a building set specially apart for
      the transaction of their affairs. Then, in 1322, Bishop Cobham of
      Worcester added a chapel to the north-east corner of St. Mary's, and gave
      it to the University as a House of Congregation. The office of Proctor had
      already been instituted, and that functionary had plenty of students to
      employ his time&mdash;30,000 one writer assures us, but him we cannot
      credit. A fourth of that number is a liberal estimate. They lived in Halls
      and lodgings, a hard and an undisciplined life, preyed upon by the
      townsfolk and biting their thumbs at them in return (whence collisions
      frequently ensued) until Walter de Merton devised the College system, to
      the no small advantage of all concerned.

      Benefactions poured in upon the several Colleges, but the greater
      institution was not forgotten. In the Divinity School, within whose walls
      Latimer and Ridley defended their opinions, and Charles II.'s Parliament
      debated, the University possesses, as is fit and proper, the most
      beautiful room in Oxford and one of the most beautiful in England. The
      style is Perpendicular and the ceiling is particularly admirable. Together
      with the fine room above it, in which Duke Humphrey's manuscripts were
      housed, the Divinity School was completed in 1480.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those six hundred manuscripts of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, which he
      bestowed on the University, had a sad history. They were dispersed by
      Edward VI.'s Commissioners, who judged them to be popish in tendency, and
      only four of them were ever restored to their old home. Nevertheless, Duke
      Humphrey's gift was the origin of the Bodleian Library. One does not like
      to think what the Library was like in the days which followed, when its
      manuscripts were scattered abroad and its shelves sold; but in the last
      years of the sixteenth century there arose a man who took pity upon its
      desolation. This was Sir Thomas Bodley, Fellow of Merton, a man of travel
      and affairs, who devoted the last years of his life to the creation of
      what is now one of the most famous libraries in existence. It has ever
      been the delight of scholars since the days of James I., who wished he
      might be chained to the Library, as some of the books were.

      The original chamber did not long suffice to contain the volumes; an east
      and then a west wing were added, the latter over Archbishop Laud's
      Convocation House (1640) which superseded Cobham's Chapel. From these the
      books overflowed into various rooms in the Old Schools Quadrangle, which
      had been rebuilt in James I.'s reign. Further space was gained in 1860,
      when the Radcliffe, set free by the removal of its collection of
      scientific works to the New Museum, was lent to the Bodleian; and again in
      1882, on the opening of the New Examination Schools (sketched by Mr.
      Matthison), when the Old Schools were rendered available for the uses of
      the Library.

      The various public buildings belonging to the University erected during
      the nineteenth century, such as the Taylor Institution, the University Art
      Galleries, the New Museum, and the Indian Institute, can hardly escape
      attracting the attention of visitors to Oxford. It remains to say a word
      of two older structures, which appear side by side in Mr. Matthison's next
      drawing&mdash;the Clarendon Building and the Sheldonian Theatre.

      The Clarendon Building was designed by Vanbrugh, and completed in 1713. It
      is named after the author of the <i>History of the Rebellion</i>, and was
      partially built out of the profits of the copyright of that work, which
      Clarendon's son presented to the University. It was the home of the
      University Press until 1830, and is now occupied by the offices of various
      University Boards.

      The Sheldonian Theatre, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, is associated
      with less tranquil occupations. It is here that honorary degrees are
      conferred and the Encænia held; here the <i>Terræ Filius</i>, a licensed
      jester, used to hurl his witticisms at whomsoever he pleased; and here, in
      later times, the occupants of the Undergraduates' Gallery have endeavoured
      to keep up his tradition. Here, too, Convocation sometimes meets, when a
      burning question is to be discussed and Masters of Arts assemble in their
      hundreds. On such occasions the Sheldonian has been known to be as full of
      clamour as at the Encænia. It is perhaps pleasanter to view Wren's
      stately building when it is void alike of undergraduate merriment and of
      graduate contention.

      Mary's, being a parish Church, cannot be numbered among the buildings
      which are University property, it has been almost as closely connected as
      any of them with the life and history of the University. Cobham's Chapel,
      as has been already said, was the first House of Congregation; and in the
      room above it the University kept its manuscripts, until Duke Humphrey's
      Library was built. The chancel and nave, moreover, were used by the
      gownsmen for both religious and secular purposes; and it is strange to
      reflect that consecrated walls heard not only sermons and disputations,
      but the jests of the <i>Terræ Filius</i> and the uproar which they
      excited. It was only when the Sheldonian was built (1669) that St. Mary's
      ceased to be the scene of the "Act"&mdash;the modern Encænia&mdash;and was
      restored to its original intention.

      The porch, with its spiral columns and statue of the Virgin and Child, is
      much later than the rest of the building, being the work of Dr. Owen,
      Archbishop Laud's chaplain. Architecturally it is not in keeping with the
      nave and spire, but in itself, especially when the creeper which
      en-wreathes it takes on its autumnal colour, it is very beautiful. It was
      found necessary, in 1895, to restore the spire, which with the pinnacles
      at its base is the special glory of St. Mary's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church is intimately connected with the religious history of the
      nation. Here Keble preached the famous Assize Sermon, which is regarded as
      the beginning of the Oxford Movement; here, too, Newman, before he
      withdrew to his retirement at Littlemore, preached those many sermons to
      whose spiritual force men of all schools of thought have borne witness. A
      later vicar was Dean Burgon, to whose memory the west window was put up in
      1891.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cranmer's connection with St. Mary's transcends all its other
      associations. On September 12, 1555, he was here put on trial for his
      religious opinions, which he defended with as much ability as courage. He
      was then recommitted to his prison, and in December Rome pronounced him
      guilty. The hardships of his imprisonment told upon his resolution, and he
      was induced to write several letters of submission, in which his so-called
      errors were recanted. On March 21, 1556, he was once more brought to St.
      Mary's. His life was to be taken, but he was to crown his humiliation by a
      public confession. Placed upon a wooden stage over against the pulpit, he
      had to hear a sermon, at the close of which he was to speak. His fortitude
      returned, and to the amazement of all he recanted his recantation. "As for
      the Pope"&mdash;these were his memorable words&mdash;"I utterly refuse
      him, as Christ's enemy and Antichrist, with all his false doctrine; and as
      for the Sacrament, I believe as I have taught in my book against the
      Bishop of Winchester. And for as much as my hand offended, writing
      contrary to my heart, my hand shall first be punished therefore; for, may
      I come to the fire, it shall be first burned." He was hurried off to the
      stake, and there
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "lifted his left hand to heaven,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And thrust his right into the bitter flame;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And crying in his deep voice, more than once,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'This hath offended&mdash;this unworthy hand!'
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So held it till it was all burn'd, before

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the east end of
      the choir aisle of the Cathedral there is a portion of the wall which is
      possibly the oldest piece of masonry in Oxford, for it is thought to be a
      part of the original Church of St. Frideswyde, on whose site the Cathedral
      Church of Christ (to give its full title) now stands. Even so it is not
      possible to speak with historical certainty of the saint or of the date of
      her Church, which was built for her by her father, so the legend says,
      when she took the veil; though the year 740 may be provisionally accepted
      as the last year of her life. St. Frideswyde's was a conventual Church,
      with a Priory attached, and both were burnt down in 1002, but rebuilt by
      Ethelred. How much of his handiwork survives in the present structure it
      is not easy to determine; but the Norman builders of the twelfth century
      effected, at any rate, such a transformation that no suggestion of Saxon
      architecture is obtruded. Their work went on for some twenty years, under
      the supervision of the then Prior, Robert of Cricklade, and the Church was
      consecrated anew in 1180. The main features of the interior&mdash;the
      massive pillars and arches&mdash;are substantially the same to-day as the
      builders left them then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Priory was surrendered to Henry VIII. in 1522, who made it over to
      Wolsey. That cardinal, in his zeal for the new College, which he now
      proceeded to found, shewed little respect for the old Church. He
      practically demolished its west end to make room for his building
      operations. The truncated Church was used as a chapel for his students,
      until the new and magnificent one which he had planned should be
      completed. That edifice was never built. Wolsey was disgraced, and the
      king took over St. Frideswyde's, to be the Cathedral Church of his newly
      created diocese of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this date, then, 1546, it is a Cathedral, but a College chapel also;
      for Henry was content that the one building should serve the two purposes.
      The Cathedral was restored in the seventeenth century and again in the
      nineteenth, with considerable alterations. It is hardly worth while here
      to enumerate these in their entirety; but when one sees in old engravings
      the beautiful east window, put up in the fourteenth century, which was
      removed at the time of Sir Gilbert Scott's restoration, it is impossible
      not to regret a change which appears to be quite unjustifiable. At the
      same time it may be readily admitted that the east end, designed on Norman
      lines, which the architect substituted, has considerable beauty, and
      harmonises with the general tone of the building. Regret is unavailing,
      and it is perhaps wiser to console oneself with the reflection that at any
      rate things might have been worse.

      The Cathedral is so hemmed in by the various buildings of Christ Church
      that it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive view from the outside.
      Perhaps one sees it best from Merton Fields, with the beautiful Rose
      Window prominently visible. Even so the Cathedral is in part hidden by the
      ancient Refectory of St. Frideswyde's (long since converted into rooms).
      This is the view, sketched from the nearer foreground of the Canon's
      Garden, which appears in Mr. Matthison's drawing, only that the Rose
      Window is hidden by trees. The spire&mdash;or spire and tower combined&mdash;no
      longer holds the bells which chimed originally in Osney Abbey, on the
      river's farther side; they were removed to the new Belfry (completed in
      1879), which appears to the left of the Refectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now to speak of the interior of the building. It is sketched from
      various points of view in the accompanying six illustrations: but twice as
      many would not suffice to exhaust its interest. At no time does the nave
      appear more impressive than when a shaft of sunlight strikes across the
      massive columns; and Miss Cheesewright has sought to fix upon her canvas
      the charm of such a moment. The Lady Chapel was added early in the
      thirteenth century; here are enshrined the remains of St. Frideswyde,
      which were moved several times before they reached their final
      resting-place. The Latin Chapel dates from the fourteenth century, and is
      full of interest. Some of its carved woodwork is to be referred to
      Wolsey's time, and it contains the tombs, among others, of Lady Elizabeth
      Montacute, the Chapel's reputed builder, and of Sir George Nowers, a
      comrade-in-arms of the Black Prince. Other notable tombs in various parts
      of the Cathedral are those of Robert Burton, author of the <i>Anatomy of
      Melancholy</i>; Bishop Berkeley, the metaphysician and upholder of the virtues
      of tar-water; Bishop King, last Abbot of Osney and first Bishop of Oxford;
      Dean Liddell and Dr. Pusey. A window in the south transept depicts the
      murder of Thomas à Becket, whose head has been obliterated, by the order,
      it is said, of Henry VIII. Another window in the same transept
      commemorates Canon Liddon. The art of Burne-Jones has contributed not a
      little to the Cathedral's beauty. In the east window of the Latin Chapel
      he has set forth the romantic story of St. Frideswyde. Another of the
      windows which he designed is at the east end of the Lady Chapel, and
      serves as a memorial of Mr. Vyner, who was murdered by Greek brigands in
      1870; another, at the east end of the north aisle of the choir,
      commemorates St. Cecilia, with which corresponds a "St. Catherine of
      Alexandria" in the south aisle, put up in memory of Miss Edith Liddell,
      daughter of Dean Liddell. Lastly, at the west end of this aisle, the
      artist has chosen "Faith, Hope, and Charity" as his subject.

      The Cloister and Chapter-House (thirteenth century) must not be
      overlooked. The entrance to the Chapter-House is by a singularly fine
      Norman doorway. The Cloister saw the unworthy degradation of Archbishop
      Cranmer, after the Pope had pronounced him guilty of heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough has perhaps been said to shew intending visitors to Oxford that the
      interest of the Cathedral is both great and varied. To those who already
      know it, these hints will seem a poor and inadequate attempt to express
      its manifold charm, but the pictures may serve to emphasise their vivid
      recollections. Those who have yet to make acquaintance with it will
      perhaps exclaim, as the Queen of Sheba did of Solomon's wisdom and
      prosperity, "Behold, the half was not told me."

      THE STREETS OF OXFORD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HERE is the
      centre, the <i>&#8000;&#956;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#8134;&#962;</i> of Oxford? The average undergraduate will
      probably place it within the walls of his own College; but we, detached
      observers whose salad days, presumably, are over, look for a definition
      worthy of more catholic acceptance. To us Oxford is not a city of Colleges
      only, but of noble streets and wide spaces. Them it is our purpose to
      explore, not with the hasty stride of one bound for lecture-room, or
      cricket-ground, or river, but leisurely and with discrimination; we are
      ready to be chidden for curiosity, so we incur not the gravamen of
      indifference. Where, then, shall we start on our pilgrimage, and from what
      centre? If there be in any city a place where four principal roads meet,
      as at the Cross in Gloucester, we may listen there for the pulsations of
      that city's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a place there is in Oxford, Carfax,&mdash;<i>Quatre voies</i>,&mdash;the
      spot where four ways meet. This, not too arbitrarily, we will name the
      centre of Oxford, and thence will wend upon our pilgrimage. But let us
      pause a moment, before we set out, at the parting of the ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Church of St. Martin's at Carfax was pulled down in 1896, and only
      the tower left. St. Martin's was the church of the city fathers, as St.
      Mary's was (and is) the church of the University. Nowadays the civic
      procession winds its way to All Saints, a nearer neighbour of St. Mary's.
      Such propinquity would have sorted ill with the manners of mediaeval
      Oxford, when the enmity of town and gown, at times quiescent, was never
      wholly quelled. In an age when the clerks, regular and secular, fell out
      among themselves in the precincts of St. Mary's, even to the shedding of
      blood, it is idle to look for a more civil temper in the burgesses: and
      the bells of Carfax and St. Mary's summoned those who frequented them to
      battle as well as to prayer. They rang out with the former intention on
      the feast of St. Scholastica in 1354. It is sad to record that the quarrel
      arose in a tavern, where two gownsmen abused the vintner for serving them
      with wine of wretched quality. The conflict which ensued was of a very
      deadly nature. The scholars held their own until evening, when the
      citizens called the neighbouring villagers of Cowley and Headington to
      their aid, and the Gown were routed. As many as forty students were slain,
      and twenty-three townsmen. Then Edward III. took steps to protect the men
      of learning, lowering, among other measures, the tower of Carfax, because
      they complained that in times of combat the townsmen retired thither as to
      a castle, and from its summit grievously annoyed and galled them with
      arrows and stones. The burgesses also were forced to attend annually at
      St. Mary's Church, when mass was offered for the souls of the slain,
      bearing on their persons sundry marks of degradation; and though these
      were subsequently done away, it was only in 1825 that they were excused
      the indignity of attending the commemorative service.

      Such are some of the memories evoked by the Tower of Carfax, the best view
      of which is given in Mr. Matthison's first drawing. The second
      illustration is from a point rather farther to the eastward. Both give a
      glimpse of the Mitre Hotel, most picturesque of old Oxford hostelries, and
      the second a part of the front of All Saints. At this point we may for a
      moment leave the High Street (which we have begun to traverse, half
      insensibly, under the artist's guidance) and wander down "The Turl," as
      Turl Street is commonly called. "Turl" is said to be a corruption of
      Thorold, and Thorold to have been the name of a postern-gate in the old
      city walls. The quiet old street has Colleges on either hand, Lincoln,
      Exeter, and Jesus. Retracing our footsteps, we get the fine view of All
      Saints which is given in the third illustration. The history of this
      Church, known originally as All Hallows, goes back to the twelfth century,
      but the present building, designed by Dr. Aldrich, a former Dean of Christ
      Church, has only been in existence since 1708, the old one having been
      destroyed in 1699 by the fall of its spire. The present graceful tower and
      spire are a worthy memorial of Dean Aldrich's versatility.

      We now return to our exploration of "The High," whose magnificence of
      outline become more and more apparent as one walks eastwards. It was a
      poet bred at Cambridge, no less a poet than Wordsworth, whom the manifold
      charm of Oxford tempted "to slight his own beloved Cam"; and he it is who
      has written the most quotable description of "The High" in brief. "The
      streamlike windings of that glorious street," he writes: and indeed its
      curve suggests nothing so much as the majestic bend of some noble river.
      We may cite, too, Sir Walter Scott's testimony, who claimed that the High
      Street of Edinburgh is the most magnificent in Great Britain, <i>except
      the High Street of Oxford</i>. It is not at all difficult to assent to
      this opinion. As the view gradually unfolds itself, we have on our left
      successively the new front of Brasenose, St. Mary's, All Souls, Queen's,
      and Magdalen; on our right the long, dark front of University, and many
      old dwelling-houses, whose architecture does not shame their situation.
      Looking backward for a moment at Queen's College (perhaps when the west is
      rosy, as in Mr. Matthison's drawing), one sees substantially the same view
      which delighted Wordsworth in 1820; and we, if we are wise, shall take as
      much delight in it as he. Many thousand times since then has the sun set
      behind the spires of St. Mary's and All Saints, but the unaltered prospect
      obliterates the intervening years, and we are at one with the great poet
      in his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast is always pleasant, and one may reach Broad Street (which
      certainly must not be neglected) by several thoroughfares totally unlike
      "The High." We may traverse Long Wall Street, with Magdalen Grove on our
      right, a pleasance hidden from the wayfarer by a high wall, but visible to
      such as lodge in upper rooms on the other side of the way; thence along
      Holywell Street, with its queer medley of old houses, many of them
      pleasing to the eye. Or, still greater contrast, we may go by Queen's and
      New College Lanes, with their rectangular turns and severe masonry on
      either side. Or, again, we may go through the Radcliffe square with its
      massive buildings on every hand&mdash;the Radcliffe dome in the centre,
      girt about with St. Mary's, Brasenose, All Souls, and the Old Schools. In
      any case we find ourselves, at the last, in Broad Street.

      It is a wide and quiet street, with comparatively little traffic, a street
      dear to meditation. Some such suggestion is conveyed by Mr. Matthison's
      sketch. He has not given us here the fronts of Balliol, Trinity, or
      Exeter,&mdash;views of the first two will be found later on,&mdash;but
      just the old houses (the one in dark relief is Kettell Hall, built by a
      President of Trinity in the seventeenth century) asleep in the sunshine,
      with the Sheldonian on the right, whose guardian figure-heads,
      traditionally said to represent the twelve Cæsars, seem by the expression
      of their stony countenances to be thinking hard of nothing in particular.
      At the other end of Broad Street, marked by a flat cross in the roadway,
      is the spot where tradition says the martyrs suffered for their faith.

      Their Memorial is a little distance off, in the neighbouring street of St.
      Giles'. It is an effective and graceful structure, with characteristic
      statues of Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, and an inscription stating the
      manner of their death and the reasons for their martyrdom. It was erected
      in 1841, by public subscription, when also the north aisle of the adjacent
      Church of St. Mary Magdalen was rebuilt out of the same fund. The Memorial
      appears twice in Mr. Matthison's drawings; once at the approach of
      evening, looking towards the city, and once as it is seen in full
      daylight, with the widening vista of St. Giles' Street in the background.
      St. Giles' is surely the widest street in the three kingdoms; Broad Street
      is narrow when compared with it. Each September it is the scene of what is
      said to be the largest and the oldest fair in England. But we have not
      chosen a fair-day for our pilgrimage.

    <h2>
      THE RIVER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F the "towers of
      Julius" are, as Gray called them, "London's lasting shame," the River is
      the lasting pride of Oxford. When does "The River" cease to be Isis and
      become Thames? One might as well ask when it ceases to be Thames and
      becomes Isis. The term is probably not used out of Oxford, and with much
      vagueness there. Matthew Arnold speaks of "the stripling Thames at
      Bablock-Hythe" (a very lovely ferry higher up than Oxford), and at
      Abingdon nobody talks about the Isis. The use of the name is one of the
      odd and pleasant conservatisms of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, there are two rivers in Oxford, according to the map, Thames
      and Cherwell; but to the undergraduate there are three&mdash;"The River,"
      "The Upper River," and "The Cher." For the sake of strangers it may be
      well to elucidate this enigma. "The River" is that part of the Thames
      which begins at Folly Bridge and ends at Sandford, except that on the
      occasion of "long courses" and Commemoration picnics it is prolonged as
      far as Nuneham. It is understood subsequently to pass through several
      counties and reach eventually the German Ocean. You do not go upon "The
      River" commonly for amusement, but for stern and serious work. You aspire
      to a thwart in your College "torpid" first, then in your College "eight,"
      with the fantastic possibility of a place in the "Trials" or&mdash;crown
      of all&mdash;in the 'Varsity "Eight" on some distant and auspicious day!
      It is no child's-play that is involved, as every oarsman knows. "The
      River" is an admirable school of self-control and self-denial, and
      "training"&mdash;long may it flourish!&mdash;is one of the best of
      disciplines. It has been said, and with truth, that boating-men are the
      salt of undergraduate society.

      The "Torpids" are rowed in March&mdash;you will appreciate this fact if
      you are rowing "bow" and a hailstorm comes on&mdash;in eight-oared boats
      with fixed seats. The name bestowed on them seems a little unkind. The
      "Eights" come off in the summer term, when sliding seats are used&mdash;to
      the greater comfort of the oarsmen, and the greater gratification of the
      lookers-on, for this rowing is out of all comparison prettier, and of
      course the boats travel at a greater pace. Both "Eights" and "Torpids," as
      most people are aware, are bumping races; that is, the boats start each at
      a given distance from the one behind it, and the object is to bump the
      boat in front, and so bump one's way to that proudest of all positions,
      "the Head of the River." A bump in front of the Barges (which Mr.
      Matthison has sketched), following a long and stern chase from Iffley, is
      a thing to live for.
    </p>
    <p>
      West of Folly Bridge "The River" might as well, for all the ordinary
      undergraduate knows of it, sink for some distance, like a certain classic
      stream, beneath the ground. Venturesome explorers tell of a tract of water
      put to base mechanical uses, flanked by dingy wharves and overlooked by
      attic windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to most boating-men "The River" ends at Salter's, only to reappear in
      the modified form and style of "The Upper River" at Port Meadow. "The
      Upper River" is some distance from everything else, but it is well worth
      the journey to Port Meadow. There is nothing strenuous about "The Upper
      River." It always seems afternoon there, and a lazy afternoon. The
      standard of oarsmanship may not be very high, but no one is in a hurry and
      no one is censorious. To enjoy the Upper River as it deserves to be
      enjoyed, you should have laboured at the Torpid oar a Lent Term, and have
      found yourself not required (this year) for the Eight. You know quite
      enough of rowing, in such a case, to cut a figure on the Upper River; but
      you will not want to cut it. If you appreciate your surroundings properly,
      you will want to sit in the stern while somebody else does the rowing; or,
      if you take an oar, you will want to pull in leisurely fashion and to look
      about you as you please, in the blissful absence of raucous injunctions to
      "keep your eyes in the boat." There is much that is pleasant to look upon&mdash;the
      wide expanse of Port Meadow on the right, on the towpath willows waving in
      the wind, and on the water here and there the white sail of a
      centre-board. As you draw near Godstow, you may see cattle drinking,
      knee-deep in the stream; you may land and refresh yourself, if you will,
      at the "Trout" at Godstow; may visit the ruins of the nunnery, with their
      memories of "Fair Rosamond;" or, leaning on the bridge-rail over Godstow
      weir, lulled by the ceaseless murmur of the water, may muse upon the
      vanity of mere ambition and the servitude of such as row in College
      Eights. Then, if the day be young enough, you may go on to Eynsham or to
      Bablock-Hythe, and perhaps afoot to Stanton-Harcourt, a most lovely
      village; and returning at dusk, when the stream appears to widen
      indefinitely as the light fails, you will vow that for sheer peace and
      enjoyment there is nothing like the Upper River.

      Unless, indeed, it be the Cherwell. This little stream, which flows into
      the Isis near the last of the Barges, while it winds about Christ Church
      Meadow, Magdalen, and Mesopotamia, is edged about, with shadowy walks; but
      once clear of the Parks, it is embedded in grassy and flower-laden banks,
      through which your boat passes with a lively sense of exploration.
      Presently, at a break in all this greenery, you come abreast of a grey
      stone building, with ancient gables and air of reposeful dignity.
      Instinctively your oar-blades rest upon the water, for so much beauty
      demands more than a moment's admiration. It is Water Eaton Hall, one of
      those smaller Elizabethan manor-houses which have survived the violence of
      the Rebellion and the neglect of impoverished owners. All about its aged
      masonry is the growth and freshness of the spring. Oxford is several miles
      away, but even so you are reminded of her special charm&mdash;the
      association of reverend age with youth's perennial renewal.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ERTON is in
      several respects the most interesting of the Colleges of Oxford. In the
      first place, it is the oldest; for though the original endowments of
      University and Balliol were bestowed a little earlier, Merton was the
      first College to have a corporate existence, regulated and defined by
      statute. With the granting of Merton's statutes in 1264, a new era of
      University life began. From being casual sojourners in lodgings and Halls,
      students from this date tended more and more to be gathered into
      organised, endowed, and dignified societies, where discipline was one of
      the factors of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is Oxford's debt to Walter de Merton, Chancellor of England and
      Bishop of Rochester, who died by a fall from his horse in fording a river
      in his diocese, and was buried in Rochester Cathedral. His tomb there has
      twice been renovated by the piety of the College which he founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His statutes are preserved at Merton, and were consulted as precedents
      when other Colleges were founded, at Cambridge as well as at Oxford. "By
      the example which he set," runs the inscription on his tomb, "he is the
      founder of all existing Colleges."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another great distinction of Merton is its Library (whose interior appears
      in Mrs. Walton's sketch), which was built in 1377, by William Rede, Bishop
      of Chichester, and is the oldest Library in the kingdom.
      In monasteries and other houses where learning took refuge, books had
      hitherto been kept in chests, an arrangement which must have had its
      drawbacks, considering the weight of the volumes of those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Matthison's first drawing shews the College as seen from Merton
      Street, with the imposing tower of the Chapel in the background. A very
      fine view of the buildings of Merton, in their full extent, is obtained
      from Christ Church Meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak of them in detail, the Muniment Room is the oldest collegiate
      structure in Oxford, and possibly dates from the lifetime of the Founder.
      The Hall gateway, with its ancient oak door and enormous iron hinges, is
      of the same epoch. Of the three Quadrangles the small one to the north
      (which contains the Library) is the oldest. The front Quadrangle opens by
      a magnificent archway into the Inner, or Fellows' Court, built in 1610 in
      the late Gothic style, its south gate surmounted with pillars of the
      several Greek orders. The Common Room (1661) was the first room of the
      kind to be opened in Oxford.

      <a href="images/0097.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The beautiful Chapel has rather the appearance of a parish Church, which
      indeed it is. St. John the Baptist's parish, however, is so minute as
      hardly to need, in a city of many churches, a place of worship all to
      itself, and the building was assigned to Merton in the last decade of the
      thirteenth century, with the proviso that one of the chaplains should
      discharge such parochial duties as might arise. In the ante-chapel are the
      monuments of the famous Sir Thomas Bodley, Sir Henry Savile, once Master,
      and Antony Wood, greatest of Oxford antiquarians. Wood (who died in 1695)
      was associated with Merton all his life. He was born in the house opposite
      the College entrance, called Postmasters' Hall, and there he passed most
      of his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from him that we get a great deal of our information about early
      Oxford. Royalty has repeatedly enjoyed the hospitality of Merton, and here
      is Wood's account of a visit paid by Queen Catherine, wife of Henry VIII.
      "She vouchsafed to condescend so low as to dine with the Merton-ians, for
      the sake of the late Warden Rawlyns, at this time almoner to the king,
      notwithstanding she was expected by other Colleges." Elizabeth and her
      privy council were equally gracious, and were entertained after dinner
      with disputations performed by the Fellows. One would like to know what
      subjects were disputed, and what the queen thought of her entertainment.
      When Charles I.'s Court came to Oxford, Queen Henrietta Maria occupied the
      Warden's lodgings, which were again tenanted by Charles II.'s queen, when
      the Court fled from plague-stricken London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merton has had great men among her Fellows, but none greater than John
      Wycliffe; and among her postmasters (so the scholars are called here) no
      name captivates our sympathies more readily than that of Richard Steele,
      trooper and essayist, the friend of Addison and the husband of Prue.

      UNIVERSITY COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was long and
      hotly maintained that University College was founded by Alfred the Great,
      and by celebrating its thousandth anniversary in 1872 the College would
      seem to have accepted this pious opinion. The claim was raised as far back
      as 1387, when the College, being engaged in a lawsuit about a part of its
      estates, tried to ingratiate itself with Richard II. by representing that
      its founder was his predecessor, Alfred, and that Bede and John of
      Beverley had been among its students. Now, Bede and John of Beverley died
      about a century before Alfred was born. <i>Ex pede Herculem</i>. The
      Alfred tradition need not keep us longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      University College owes its existence to William of Durham, who, at his
      death in 1249, beqeathed to the University the sum of three hundred and
      ten marks for the use of ten or more <i>Masters</i> (at that time the
      highest academical title) to be natives of Durham or its vicinity. Certain
      tenements were purchased, one of them on a part of the site of Brasenose,
      and here, in 1253, Durham's scholars first assembled; but only in 1280
      were they granted powers of self-government. The recent foundation of
      Merton no doubt suggested the idea of bestowing a corporate life on what
      had hitherto been known as "University Hall." Durham's scholars removed to
      their present locality in 1343.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the earliest benefactors whom "Univ." (as this College is
      familiarly termed in Oxford) is bound to remember is Walter Skirlaw, who
      became Bishop of Durham in 1403. He ran away from his home in youth in
      order to study at Oxford, and his parents heard no more of him (according
      to his biographer) till he arrived at the see of Durham. He then sought
      them out, and provided for their old age. Another benefactor (1566) was
      Joan Davys, wife of a citizen of Oxford, who gave estates for the support
      of two Logic lecturers, and for increasing the diet of the Master and
      Fellows. Had Mr. Cecil Rhodes heard of this lady? To touch on the Masters
      of "Univ.," a curious career was that of Obadiah Walker, who lost his
      Fellowship in Commonwealth times for adherence to the Church of England;
      later on was made Master and turned Roman Catholic; enjoyed the favour of
      James II.; and lost his Mastership at the Revolution for adherence to the
      Church of Rome.

      Of the present buildings of the College none is of earlier date than the
      seventeenth century. The two Quadrangles form a grand front towards the
      High Street, with a tower over each gateway at equal distances from the
      extremities. Above the gateways are statues of Queen Anne and Queen Mary,
      on the outside; two more, within, represent James II. and Dr. Radcliffe.
      It was mainly at the cost of John Radcliffe, a member of the College, that
      the smaller Quadrangle was completed. Other famous members were the
      brothers Scott, afterwards Lords Stowell and Eldon; Sir William Jones, the
      great Oriental scholar; and Sir Roger Newdigate, responsible for so many
      thousand heroic couplets, who gave the handsome chimney-piece in the Hall.
      It is curious to notice, by the way, that the fireplace stood in the
      centre of this room until 1766. The Common Room contains two specimens of
      an out-of-the-way art, portraits of Henry IV. and Robert Dudley, Earl of
      Leicester, burnt in wood by Dr. Griffith, a former Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful monument to the poet Shelley, set up in the College in 1893,
      is the gift of Lady Shelley. Its honoured position within the walls of the
      Foundation which drove him out so hastily and harshly is indeed a fitting
      emblem of "the late remorse of love."

    <h2>
      BALLIOL COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS College was
      originated about 1260 by John de Balliol, a baron of Durham, whose son for
      four years occupied the throne of Scotland. But inasmuch as John de
      Balliol only made provision for four students, and that as penance for an
      outrage, the greater credit attaches to his wife Dervorguilla, who endowed
      a dozen more and hired them a lodging close to St. Mary Magdalen Church,
      on the site where part of the present College stands. Devorguilla gave her
      scholars their first statutes in 1282. She bade them live temperately, and
      converse with one another in the Latin tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth to tell, as the revenues at first yielded each scholar only
      eightpence a week, riotous living seemed hardly practicable. Benefactors,
      however, presently stepped in, notably Sir Philip Somervyle of
      Staffordshire, who in 1340 raised the weekly allowance to elevenpence, and
      to fifteenpence in case victuals were dear. The grateful College accepted
      from Sir Philip a new body of statutes, in which the now familiar title,
      "Master of Balliol," makes its first appearance, a title associated twenty
      years afterwards with the honoured name of John Wycliffe. Among later
      benefactors may be mentioned Peter Blundell, founder of the Devonshire
      school which bears his name; Lady Elizabeth Periam (a sister of Francis
      Bacon); and John Snell, a native of Ayrshire,&mdash;it is to his endowment
      that Balliol owes her most distinguished Scotsmen, such as Adam Smith,
      Lockhart (Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer), and Archbishop
      Tait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balliol was an early friend to the new learning, and fostered the
      scholarly tastes of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, son of Henry IV., and
      Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester (to name but two of her most prominent
      humanists). Duke Humphrey left his books to the University, six hundred in
      number&mdash;a very large collection for those days, when as yet Caxton
      had not revolutionised the world. And in Reformation days, when the
      humanities were called to account, learning found a zealous supporter in
      Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, who had been bred at Balliol.

      The annals of the College during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
      are not particularly distinguished. After the Restoration Balliol men seem
      to have been considerably addicted to malt liquors, and much ale does not
      conduce to profound study. But modern Balliol men might apply to their own
      use the words of Dr. Ingram's famous song, "Who fears to speak of '98?"
      for it was in 1798 that Dr. Parsons became Master of the College, and with
      his advent began the great days of Balliol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parsons, with two other heads of houses, established the Examination
      system, which has been so much belauded and so much abused. It was soon
      apparent that Balliol tutors had the knack of equipping men to face the
      ordeal of "the Schools"; the College speedily came to the front, and its
      intellectual pre-eminence in Oxford during the nineteenth century is now
      universally admitted. Men trained at Balliol during this period occupied
      and still occupy some of the very highest positions in the State. Not to
      mention the living, whose fame is in the mouths of all men, some of the
      most prominent names are those of Lords Coleridge, Bowen, and Peel
      (formerly Speaker of the House of Commons), Sir Robert Morier, and
      Archbishop Temple. Matthew Arnold and Clough were undergraduates at
      Balliol with Benjamin Jowett, afterwards its most famous Master; and, to
      balance the severity of these poets, the lighter Muse of Calverley
      sojourned for a time within its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buildings of Balliol, which Mr. Matthison has sketched from four
      points of view, are extensive, but not conspicuously beautiful. The front
      towards Broad Street was rebuilt in 1867 by Mr. Waterhouse. Old prints
      assure us that it had previously a forbidding and almost prison-like
      aspect. Mr. Matthison calls attention to the fact that this picture shows
      the spot where the martyrs were burned. The automobile in the foreground
      may suggest to the thoughtful reader that martyrdom is no longer by fire.
      The drawing from St. Giles' perhaps conveys a pleasanter impression. The
      third shews us that part of the College known as "Fisher's Buildings,"
      erected at the cost of a former Fellow in 1769. The fourth drawing is of
      the Garden Quadrangle with the Chapel on the left (rebuilt in 1856); here
      the surroundings are more attractive; we are looking on "a grove of
      Academe," in which vigorous minds may still, as heretofore, grow happily
      towards their maturity.

    <h2>
      EXETER COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS College,"
      wrote Fuller the historian, in words which Exeter men will approve,
      "consisteth chiefly of Cornish and Devonshire men, the gentry of which
      latter, Queen Elizabeth used to say, were courtiers by their birth. And as
      these western men do bear away the bell for might and sleight in
      wrestling, so the scholars here have always acquitted themselves with
      credit in <i>Palæstra literaria!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The western College was founded in 1314 by Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of
      Exeter, who twelve years later met his death as a supporter of Edward II.,
      when that king was overthrown and murdered. A later and liberal patron was
      Sir William Petre, father of Dorothy Wadham, a statesman of the Tudor
      period. Of the ancient buildings of Exeter hardly anything remains. The
      Hall dates from the seventeenth century, the fronts to the Turl and Broad
      Streets from the nineteenth. The present Chapel is the third in which
      Exeter men have worshipped. Designed by Sir Gilbert Scott on the model of
      the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, it is certainly the most attractive of the
      College buildings. Its interior is richly decorated, and contains a
      tapestry representing "The Visit of the Magi," the work of Burne-Jones and
      William Morris, formerly undergraduates of Exeter.

      Among interesting members of this Foundation may be cited Dr. Prideaux,
      Rector from 1612 to 1642, who began residence at Exeter as a
      kitchen-knave, and lived to be a Bishop; the first Lord Shaftesbury,
      Dryden's "Achitophel"; the Marquis of Winchester, a loyal Cavalier, whose
      epitaph by the same poet may be read in Englefield Church, Berkshire;
      William Browne, author of <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>; and Sir Simon
      Baskerville (<i>ob.</i> 1641), an eminent physician, who would take no fee from
      any clergyman under the rank of dean. The Fellows' Gardens, a secluded and
      beautiful spot, contains two noted trees, a large chestnut known as
      "Heber's Tree," from the fact that it overshadowed his rooms in Brasenose,
      and "Dr. Kennicott's Fig Tree." Dr. Kennicott, the great Hebrew scholar,
      regarded this tree as peculiarly his own. During his proctorate, some
      irreverent undergraduates stole its fruit, upon which Dr. Kennicott caused
      a board to be hung upon it, inscribed "The Proctor's Fig." Next morning it
      was discovered that someone had substituted the audacious legend, "A fig
      for the Proctor."

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>RIEL COLLEGE was
      founded by Adam de Brome, almoner to King Edward II., in 1324. He was
      Rector of St. Mary's, whose spire forms with the dome of the Radcliffe a
      background to the view of Oriel Street, and obtained leave from the king
      to transfer the Church and its revenues to his College. The College
      originally had the same title as the Church, but five years after its
      foundation it received from King Edward III. a messuage known as <i>La
      Oriole</i> (a title of disputed meaning), and from this date was renamed
      "Oriel College."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Front Quadrangle, whose exterior and interior are here depicted, was
      erected in the first half of the seventeenth century. Viewed from without,
      it has an air of quiet dignity; but the visitor will be even better
      pleased when he has passed the Porter's Lodge. A striking feature is the
      central flight of steps, with a portico, by which the Hall is reached. On
      either side of the statues of the two kings (Edward II. and Charles I.)
      stretches a trio of finely moulded windows, flanked by an oriel to right
      and left. Mr. Matthison clearly made his drawing when the "Quad." was gay
      with flowers and Eights-week visitors, but at no season is it anything but
      beautiful. The Garden Quadrangle, which lies to the north and includes the
      Library, was built during the eighteenth century. The adjacent St. Mary
      Hall, with its buildings, was recently incorporated with Oriel, on the
      death of its last Principal, Dr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among famous men nurtured at this College were Raleigh, Prynne, Bishop
      Butler, and Gilbert White, the naturalist; but it was in the first half of
      the nineteenth century that Oriel's intellectual renown was at its highest.
      To recall the names of Pusey, Keble, Newman, Whately, and Thomas Arnold
      suffices to indicate the subject which most preoccupied the Oxford of that
      epoch. Oriel seemed fated to be the seat of religious controversy, from
      the seventeenth century days of Provost Walter Hodges, whose <i>Elihu</i>,
      a treatise on the Book of Job, brought him into suspicion of favouring the
      sect of Hutchinsonians. Happily there was some tincture of humour in the
      differences of those days. When this Provost resented the imputation, his
      detractors told him that a writer on the Book of Job should take
      everything with patience. Controversy apart, any College might be proud of
      a group of Fellows of whom one became an archbishop, another a really
      great headmaster, and a third a cardinal. Oriel has had poets, too, within
      her gates, for in a later day Clough and Matthew Arnold won fellowships
      here.

      But Oriel has had no more dutiful son, if liberality is any measure of
      dutifulness, than Cecil Rhodes. It is too soon to appraise the value of
      his scholarship scheme, which provides an Oxford education for numerous
      colonial and foreign students; but his old College, which benefited so
      largely by the provisions of his will, can have no hesitation in including
      him among its benefactors.

      QUEEN'S COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>PINIONS will
      differ as to whether the Italian style, of which this College is a fine
      example, is as suitable for collegiate buildings as the Gothic, and
      whether the contrast which Queen's presents to its neighbour, University,
      is not more striking than pleasing; but the intrinsic splendour of its
      façade, as viewed from "The High," is indisputable. "No spectacle," said
      Dr. Johnson, "is nobler than a blaze"; and those who saw the west wing of
      the Front Quadrangle of Queen's in flames, one summer night in 1886, must
      have felt their regrets tempered by admiration, so imposing was the sight.
      Happily the damage was mainly confined to the interior of the building. A
      fire had already devastated the same wing in 1778. On that occasion, as
      Mr. Wells narrates in <i>Oxford and its Colleges</i>, the Provost of the
      day "nearly lost his life for the sake of decorum. He was sought for in
      vain, and had been given up, when he suddenly emerged from the burning
      pile, full dressed as usual, in wig, gown, and bands." This recalls
      Cowley's story of a gentleman in the Civil Wars, who might have escaped
      from his captors had he not stayed to adjust his perriwig. Less fortunate
      than the Provost, his sense of ceremony cost him his life.

      Queen's College was founded by Robert Eglesfield of Cumberland, Confessor
      to Philippa, Edward III.'s queen. Impressed with the lack of facilities
      for education among Englishmen of the North, he practically restricted the
      benefits of his Foundation to students from the north country, and Queen's
      is still intimately connected with that part of England. Philippa did her
      best for her Confessor's institution, and later queens have shewn a
      similar interest. The statue under the cupola, above the gateway,
      represents Queen Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the Library (1696) and the east side of the Inner
      Quadrangle, all the present buildings were erected in the eighteenth
      century. The Library, a handsome room in the classical style, was
      decorated by Grinling Gibbons, and contains, as well as a very valuable
      collection of books, ancient portraits on glass of Henry V. and Cardinal
      Beaufort. The Chapel (1714) was designed by Wren, and the Front Quadrangle
      by his pupil Hawksmoor.

      Queen's is tenacious of her old customs. Still the trumpet calls the
      Fellows to dinner; still, on Christmas day, the boar's head is brought in

      plenty.

      Peace and plenty, at any rate, have characterised the annals of Queen's;
      and among those who have enjoyed these good things within her walls may be
      mentioned "Prince Hal," Addison (before his migration to Magdalen),
      Tickell, Wycherley, Bentham, Jeffrey of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and
      Dr. Thomson, late Archbishop of York.

      The origin of St. Edmund Hall is uncertain, but it is commonly supposed to
      derive its name from Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1234 to
      1240. Its buildings, grouped round three sides of an oblong quadrangle,
      date from the middle of the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first view shews the entrance to the Hall, with the interesting old
      Church of St. Peter-in-the-East in the background. The crypt and chancel
      of this Church take us back to the times of the Conqueror, and may have
      been the work of Robert D'Oily, one of William's Norman followers, who is
      known to have built Oxford Castle.

      In the view of the interior of the Quadrangle the building at the back is
      the Library; the abundance of creepers on the left hand adds to the idea
      of comfort suggested by the homeliness of the architecture.

      Hearne, the antiquary, was a member of St. Edmund Hall; so also was Sir
      Richard Blackmore, who was in residence for thirteen years. It was his
      lot, says Johnson, "to be much oftener mentioned by enemies than by
      friends"; but this is hardly surprising, in view of the interminable epics
      which he inflicted upon his contemporaries.

    <h2>
      NEW COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS College, in
      respect of its buildings and its endowments, is one of the most splendid
      in the University. Its founder, William of Wykeham, rose through the
      favour of Edward III. to high positions in Church and State, being made
      Bishop of Winchester in 1366 and Chancellor of England in the following
      year. He was a man of affairs, liberal and tolerant, who took delight in
      building, and had himself great skill in architecture. He had already,
      before he designed New College, as Clerk of the Works to Edward III.,
      rebuilt Windsor Castle. Doubtless, zeal for education was one of his
      incentives; but he must have known a deep gratification, as the work went
      on, in the growth of the stately buildings which were to perpetuate his
      name. Richard II.'s sanction was given in 1379, and Wykeham's Society took
      possession of its completed home in 1386. During the six years which
      followed, its founder was occupied with the building of Winchester
      College, the other great institution connected with his name. He died in
      1404, in his eightieth year, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral,
      having lived long enough to see his two Foundations prosperously started
      upon their several careers.
    </p>
    <p>
      New College, as left by William of Wykeham, consisted of the chief
      Quadrangle (which includes the Chapel, Hall, and Library), the Cloisters
      with their tower, and the gardens. It is this Quadrangle (shewing the
      Chapel) which appears in Mr. Matthison's first drawing; but it is not
      quite as Wykeham saw it, for the third storey was added, as at Brasenose,
      in the seventeenth century, when the windows also were modernised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through this Quadrangle, the visitor reaches the Garden Court,
      which is also the creation of the seventeenth century, and was built in
      imitation of the Palace of Versailles. Seen from the garden (as in the
      second illustration) it certainly has, with its fivefold frontage and its
      extensive iron palisade, a most imposing appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden contains a structure older by several centuries than any of the
      Colleges&mdash;that fragment of the old City Wall which is shewn in Mr.
      Matthison's third drawing. Its reverse side is visible from the back of
      Long Wall Street, and another fragment now acts as the wall of Merton
      garden. The city wall existed in its entirety in Wykeham's time, though
      already falling into decay: there is a brief of Richard II., issued to the
      then mayor and burgesses of Oxford, wherein the king complains of the
      ruinous state of the fortifications, and demands that they be at once
      repaired. He thought of taking refuge in Oxford, it appears, if his
      enemies in France should invade the country. He was soon to learn, at
      Flint Castle, how impotent is any masonry to protect a sovereign against
      subjects whose affections he has estranged. One may climb the old wall in
      New College garden and think of the days when it was a real defence, when
      the occupants of the "mural houses" at its base were exempted from all
      imposts, with the reservation that they should defend the wall with their
      bodies, in the event of an enemy's assault. On some part of the ground now
      occupied by the College and its garden stood several of those Halls where
      students lodged in the pre-collegiate days; but the greater part was waste
      land, strewn with rubbish and haunted by all sorts of bad characters.
      Certainly the whole community benefited, and not Wykeham's scholars only,
      when king and pope sanctioned his undertaking.

      The Cloisters, of which two views are given, are singularly beautiful.
      They were designed, together with the area which they enclose, as a
      burial-ground for the College. It is unfortunate that many of the brass
      tablets were removed during the Civil War, when the College was used as a
      garrison. Royalist pikes, in those days, were trailed in the Quadrangle,
      and ammunition was stored in Cloisters and Tower. Later on the College was
      tenanted by soldiers of the Commonwealth, who in course of fortifying it
      did some damage to the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chapel is perhaps the finest extant specimen of the Perpendicular
      style. It suffered severely during the Reformation, when the niches of the
      reredos were denuded and filled up with stone and mortar, with a coat of
      plaster over all. In course of time the original east end was
      rediscovered, and the reredos renewed. By 1894 statues were erected in the
      niches; and as the open timber roof had been replaced in 1880, the whole
      may now be considered to have been restored, as far as is possible, to its
      original appearance. The west window (in the ante-chapel) is famous as
      having been designed by Reynolds. An illustration of it is here given. The
      beauty of the figures and of the colouring is universally admitted.

      The last illustration shews the New Buildings, through which is a back
      entrance to the College, as seen from Holywell Street. Of these it must be
      said that they are far less interesting than the quaint old street in
      which they are situated. The best of them is the most recent addition, a
      fine tower put up in 1880 to the memory of a former Bursar, Mr. Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hall is a fine building, though its original proportions have been
      altered, not for the better. Here on August 29, 1605, King James I. with
      his queen and the Prince of Wales were entertained to dinner; and here on
      festival days the scholars were bidden by their Founder to amuse
      themselves after supper with singing and with recitations, whose themes
      were to be "the chronicles of the realm and the wonders of the world." On
      the walls are portraits of Chichele and William of Waynflete, members of
      the College, who were presently to rival, as Founders, the munificence of
      William of Wykeham himself; of Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, friend of
      Erasmus and promoter of humanism; and of Sydney Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exclusive connection between Winchester and New College, which the
      Founder planned, proved in course of time a disadvantage. In 1857 half the
      fellowships and a few scholarships were thrown open to public competition.
      Since then the College has largely increased its numbers, and
      representatives of all the great schools of England are sojourners within
      its walls. The Founder's motto, "Manners Makyth Man," is of too wide an
      application to be limited to the members of any one school; and it is
      permissible to think that William of Wykeham, shrewd and liberal-minded as
      he was, would approve the change. An earlier alteration he would certainly
      have endorsed. He secured as a special privilege to the Fellows of his
      Foundation, that they should be admitted to all degrees in the University
      without asking any grace of congregation, provided they passed a
      satisfactory examination in their own College. His object was to impose a
      severer educational test than that which the University then afforded;
      when, however, University examinations became a reality, his good
      intention was nullified. Wykehamists pleaded their privilege, and so
      evaded the ordeal which members of other Colleges must undergo. Thus was
      an originally good custom corrupted. The College, to its credit,
      voluntarily abjured this questionable privilege in 1834; and is now second
      only to Balliol in the intellectual race.

      The second gives the interior of the Front Quadrangle. Reference to old
      engravings, such as that given in Chalmers' <i>History of the Colleges,
      Halls, and Public Buildings of the University of Oxford</i> (1810), shews
      the battlements to be a modern addition, and anything but an improvement.

      The Chapel, which stands in the inner court, was built at the expense of
      Dr. John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln and afterwards Archbishop of York,
      and was consecrated on September 15, 1631. Its roof and wainscoting are of
      cedar, the roof in particular being richly ornamented. The painted windows
      are also noteworthy. Tradition says that they were bought by Dr. Williams
      in Italy. That at the east end represents six principal events of the
      gospel narrative, with their corresponding types in the Old Testament. The
      following is the complete list:&mdash;The Creation of Man&mdash;the
      Nativity of Christ; the Passage through the Red Sea&mdash;the Baptism of
      Christ; the Jewish Passover&mdash;the Lord's Supper; the Brazen Serpent in
      the Wilderness&mdash;the Crucifixion; Jonah delivered from the Whale&mdash;the
      Resurrection; the Ascent of Elijah in the Chariot of Fire&mdash;the
      Ascension.

    <p>
      John Wesley spent nine years in Lincoln College, being elected Fellow in
      1726. Among its members may be named Sir William Davenant, Poet Laureate;
      and Dr. Robert Sanderson, Bishop of Lincoln, a man of great piety,
      learning, and amiability, who forms the theme of one of Izaak Walton's
      <i>Lives</i>. It is to him that our English Liturgy owes the beautiful "Prayer
      for all Conditions of Men" and "General Thanksgiving." A recent Rector of
      Lincoln was Mark Pattison, B.D., who might rival Sanderson in learning,
      though not in the quality of forbearance. His <i>Memoirs</i>, posthumously
      published, contained, with much that was of interest, some unusually
      outspoken judgments upon his contemporaries in Oxford.

    <p>
      This title expresses one of the
      purposes for which All Souls was founded. It was a Chantry first, a home
      of learning afterwards. An obligation was imposed upon the Society to pray
      for the good estate of the Founders, during their lives, and for their
      souls after their decease; also for the souls of Henry V. and the Duke of
      Clarence, together with those of all the dukes, earls, barons, knights,
      esquires, and other subjects of the Crown of England who had fallen in the
      French War; and for the souls of all the faithful departed. To think of
      All Souls is to think of Agincourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to learning, sixteen of the Fellows were directed to study civil and
      canon law, the rest philosophy, theology, and the arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Founders were Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, and King Henry
      VI. Chichele is the Archbishop who in Shakespeare's <i>King Henry V</i>.
      urges the king (quite in accordance with history) to vindicate his claims
      to the crown of France. Educated in all the prejudices of his age, he set
      his face against the followers of Wyckliffe; at the same time he protested
      against the encroachments of Rome, and was spoken of in Oxford as "the
      darling of the people, and the foster-parent of the clergy." He was deeply
      read in the law, and All Souls still bears the impress of his legal
      tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buildings are very extensive, and are grouped around three
      quadrangles. The first view (which gives also a glimpse of the Radcliffe
      and the Old Schools) shews the front of the North Quadrangle, as seen from

      But the Library is eclipsed, in general opinion, by the Chapel. "It is
      usually observed," says Chalmers, "that whatever visitor remembers
      anything of Oxford, remembers the beautiful Chapel of All Souls, and joins
      in its praises." It is characterised by dignity and simplicity, and its
      great reredos has a remarkable history. The Chapel was wrecked in
      Reformation days, and the remains of the reredos were covered with plaster
      in the reign of Charles II. In 1870 some workmen accidentally discovered,
      on removing some of the plaster, the ruins of the now forgotten reredos.
      It was then reconstructed, and the empty niches refilled with statues of
      Chichele, Henry VI., and the great ones of their time. The College also
      owns a fine sundial, the work of Sir Christopher Wren, who was one of its
      Fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four Bible-clerks, as is well known, are the only undergraduates. An
      All Souls' Fellowship is now what an Oriel Fellowship was in the early
      part of the nineteenth century, the blue ribbon of Oxford. Since its
      foundation in 1437 the following are a few of the eminent men who have
      been members of this Society:&mdash;Linacre, Sheldon, Jeremy Taylor, the
      poet Young, Blackstone, and Bishop Heber.

      WAYNFLETE, who founded this College, was brought up in the traditions of
      William of Wykeham, and maintained them most worthily. A member of
      Wykeham's school, and perhaps of New College, he became Headmaster of
      Winchester, only leaving it to act as first Headmaster of Eton, on the
      foundation of that College by Henry VI. Like Wykeham he lived through
      troubled times, and like him occupied the see of Winchester and was
      Chancellor of England. The latter post he resigned in the last year of
      Henry VI., but remained Bishop of Winchester until his death in 1486. He
      was buried in Winchester Cathedral, where eighty-two years earlier Wykeham
      had been laid to rest.

      On the present site of Magdalen College stood an old hospital, named after
      St. John the Baptist. This hospital, with its grounds, was made over to
      William of Waynflete in 1457; some remains of its buildings still survive
      in what is known as the Chaplains' Quadrangle; and in this hospital the
      new society found temporary shelter. Waynflete did not proceed at once to
      build his new College; the times were disturbed, and with the victory of
      the Yorkist faction he found himself in some peril. Pardoned, however, by
      Edward IV., he was at liberty to carry out his designs. If not his own
      architect, he certainly superintended the building; and with the exception

      In the result, taste has generally decided, what most visitors feel
      instinctively at first sight, that Magdalen is the most beautiful College
      in Oxford. This distinction it owes partly to the perfect proportions of
      its buildings, and partly to the loveliness of its surroundings. To assure
      oneself of this, one may take a boat up the Cherwell (as the people in Mr.
      Matthison's first drawing have done), and, while the sculls rest idly on
      the water's surface, drink deeply of the beauty of the scene.

      The foundation stone of the famous Tower (which from different points of
      view appears in three more of the illustrations) was laid in 1492.
      Tradition says that it was designed by Wolsey, who was about that time
      Bursar of Magdalen; and also asserts that a mass for the soul of Henry
      VII. used, before the Reformation, to be performed upon the top of the
      Tower on every May-day at early morning. It is certain that a hymn is
      still sung there annually at that season, as those who are up early enough
      may hear for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether one approaches Magdalen by the water-way or by "The High"&mdash;as
      in the second illustration&mdash;the Tower is still the dominant feature
      of the view. On the left are seen St. Swithun's Buildings, designed in
      happy harmony with the older structure. When the Lodge is passed, one is
      confronted with the old stone pulpit (sketched by Mrs. Walton), from which
      an open-air sermon was formerly preached on St. John the Baptist's day. *
      The court on that occasion used to be fenced round with green boughs, in
      allusion to St. John's preaching in the wilderness.

      The Cloisters are next entered, from which is obtained a splendid view of
      Waynflete's Quadrangle and Tower (the "Founder's Tower" of the next
      illustration). The perfect grace of Magdalen is here revealed, and praise
      becomes superfluous. The Chapel, Hall, and Library open out of this
      Quadrangle. The College choir is among the best in the three kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many theories have been suggested in explanation of the curious stone
      figures in the Quadrangle, which were put up after Waynflete's day. The
      most reasonable appears to be that which makes them represent the several
      virtues and vices which members of the College should follow after and
      eschew. But even so that interpretation seems a little forced which makes
      the hippopotamus, carrying his young one on his shoulder, emblematic of "a
      good tutor, or Fellow of a College, who is set to watch over the youth of
      the society, and by whose prudence they are to be led through the dangers
      of their first entrance into the world." *

      To speak now of the three remaining illustrations, the first shews the
      garden, reached from the Quadrangle, the exterior of which forms the
      background of the picture. From here a good view is obtained of the new
      buildings, a stately eighteenth-century pile, which adjoin the deer park;
      a part of them, as well as of the deer park, is seen in Mr. Matthison's
      sketch. Finally, he gives his impression of the College as seen at evening
      from the entrance of Addison's Walk, with the Tower blue-grey against a
      paling sky.

      That walk, which commemorates "the famous Mr. Joseph Addison," as Esmond
      called him, was in part, at any rate, laid out in Queen Elizabeth's day;
      and here the future essayist may have often strolled and meditated, in the
      exercise of that gift of "a most profound silence" with which, half in
      jest, he credited himself. There stood in his time at the entrance of the
      water-walk an oak, which for centuries had been, according to Chalmers,
      "the admiration of many generations." Evelyn, the diarist, commemorates
      its huge proportions. It was overthrown by a storm in 1789, and a chair
      made of its wood is preserved in the President's lodgings.

    <p>
      Magdalen in its time has welcomed many royal visitors, among them Edward
      IV. in 1481, and Richard III. in 1483. Richard was so pleased with the
      disputations provided for his entertainment that he presented the two
      protagonists (one of them was Grocyn, the Greek scholar) with a buck
      apiece and money as well. Other guests were Arthur, Prince of Wales, elder
      son of Henry VII., and Henry, son of James I., whose great promise was cut
      short by an early death. Cromwell and Fairfax dined at Magdalen, when they
      received the degree of D.C.L. in 1649, and, instead of hearing the usual
      disputations, played at bowls upon the College green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the College had educated its fair share of prominent men:
      Wolsey; Colet, afterwards Dean of St. Paul's; Cardinal Pole; William
      Tyndale, translator of the Bible; Lyly, whose <i>Euphues</i> gave a name to a
      certain style of writing; and John Hampden. A notable President (1561) was
      Dr. Laurence Humphrey, who was among the Genevan exiles in Queen Mary's
      time. On his return he retained the Genevan dislike for ecclesiastical
      vestments, but was persuaded to wear them on the occasion of Queen
      Elizabeth's visit to Oxford. "Mr. Doctor," said the queen, who was aware
      of his usual practice, "that loose gown becomes you mighty well. I wonder
      your notions should be so narrow."

      The life of a College is in general self-contained, but in the last year
      of James II.'s reign Magdalen becomes for a time the centre of a
      constitutional struggle. There is no more glorious page in her annals.
      James II. had done his best to turn University College into a Roman
      Catholic seminary, and had made a professor of that religion Dean of
      Christ Church. He now sought to impose upon the Fellows of Magdalen a
      President of his own choosing, one Farmer, a papist, and a man of known
      bad character. The Fellows replied by electing one of their own number,
      John Hough, upon which they were cited before the Court of High Commission
      and bullied by Judge Jeffreys, while Hough's election was declared invalid.
      Farmer was so generally discredited that the king did not press his
      claims, but shortly afterwards nominated in his stead Dr. Parker, Bishop
      of Oxford. When the Fellows respectfully refused to accept him, Hough and
      twenty-six Fellows were forcibly ejected, as well as many of the "demies"
      (or scholars) who sympathised with their action. Parker died after a few
      months' tenure of office, when James named Gifford, a Roman Catholic, as
      his successor. It was only in October 1688, when moved to terror by the
      Declaration of William of Orange, that the king, among other concessions,
      cancelled Gifford's appointment and restored Dr. Hough and the ejected
      Fellows. But then, as we know, all concessions were too late. Hough
      remained President until 1701.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the eighteenth century Magdalen was not exempt from the general
      somnolence which pervaded the University. Gibbon's residence there was cut
      short by his becoming a Roman Catholic. His harsh judgment of the College,
      warped as it was, cannot be entirely refuted. Famous nineteenth-century
      members of Magdalen were Robert Lowe, Lord Selborne, Charles Reade, and
      Professor Mozley. At present it does not look as if the charge of
      inactivity could ever again be preferred against Waynflete's Foundation.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE first thing
      about this College to excite a stranger's curiosity is its name. The
      explanation is trivial enough. Brasenose Hall (which was in existence in
      the thirteenth century and became Brasenose College in 1509) was so called
      from the brass knocker&mdash;the head of a lion with a very prominent nose&mdash;which
      adorned its gateway. In 1334 the members of the Hall, from whatever
      reason, migrated into Lincolnshire, taking the knocker with them, and set
      up their rest at Stamford. "There is in Stamford," wrote Antony Wood, "a
      building in St. Paul's parish, near to one of the tower gates, called
      Brazenose to this day, and has a great gate, and a wicket, upon which
      wicket is a head or face of old cast brass, with a ring through the nose
      thereof. It had also a fair refectory within, and is at this time written
      in leases and deeds Brazen Nose." This building was bought by "B. N. C."
      (to adopt Oxford phraseology) in 1890, and the knocker brought back to
      Oxford, none the worse for its prolonged rustication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The College named after this venerable relic owes its foundation to a pair
      of friends, William Smyth, Bishop of Lincoln, and Sir Richard Sutton of
      Sutton, in the county of Cheshire, an ecclesiastically-minded layman, who
      became Steward of the monastery of Sion, near Brentford. "Unmarried
      himself," the knight's biographer informs us, "and not anxious to
      aggrandize his family, Sir Richard Sutton bestowed handsome benefactions
      and kind remembrances among his kinsmen; but he wedded the public, and
      made posterity his heir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The College which grew up under the personal supervision of these two
      friends, occupies the ground on which stood no less than eight Halls: a
      fact which seems to shew that these institutions were not large in bulk.
      The Founders purchased Brasenose Hall, Little University Hall, Salisbury
      Hall, with St. Mary's Entry&mdash;a picturesque lane, which appears in the
      first of Mr. Matthison's illustrations; and five more. Tennyson's phrase,
      "the tumult of the Halls," must have been peculiarly applicable in
      mediaeval Oxford. Distinctly mediaeval were the statues of the new
      Foundation; those who drew them up adhered to the training of the
      schoolmen, and made no provision for the new learning. When John Claymond,
      first President of Corpus, endowed six scholarships at Brasenose (in
      1536), he stipulated that the scholars appointed should attend the
      lectures of the Latin and Greek Readers of his own College. However,
      Brasenose had her own lecturers in these humaner studies, before the
      century was out.

      If one would see the Front Quadrangle as the Founders viewed it, when the
      last stones from Headington quarries were put in their places, he must
      imagine it deprived of its third tier of windows and its parapet, for
      these are Jacobean additions. The alteration, so far as it affected the
      outside, can hardly have been for the better; for the additional storey
      has certainly dwarfed the proportions of the fine Tower, which, with its
      Gateway, is the most striking feature of the second picture. As to the
      interior of the Quadrangle&mdash;sketched by Mr. Matthison from two points
      of view&mdash;it is less easy to form an opinion; the dormer windows are
      so quaintly ornamental that the severest critic may hesitate to wish them
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Architecture of a totally different order meets the eye when the Inner
      Quadrangle is reached, as a glance at the final illustration proves; for
      the Italian style is much in evidence. The foundation stone of the present
      Chapel, which represented an older one, was laid in 1656, and tradition
      attributes the design of it, as well as that of the Library, to Sir
      Christopher Wren, who was then quite a young man. Its windows are Gothic,
      but the Corinthian pilasters and the general idea of the structure shew
      that the architect's adherence was divided between the older and newer
      methods. The ceiling is elaborately carved in fanwork tracery. The Library
      stands between the Chapel and the south side of the Quadrangle. There is a
      curious regulation in the statutes directing that each volume it contained
      should be described in the catalogue by the first word on the second leaf.
      The reason of this is that the first leaf, being often splendidly
      illuminated, was liable to be torn out by dishonest borrowers; and as it
      was important to be able to identify a book, this could best be done by
      noting the first word on the second page, because it would very seldom
      happen that two copyists would begin that page with the same word. Hence
      the initial word of the second leaf of a manuscript would in all
      probability mark that individual copy and no other.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ORPUS&mdash;as
      this College is universally known among Oxford men&mdash;was founded in
      1516, during the days of the "new learning," by Richard Foxe, Bishop of
      Winchester. Zealous for education, he took care that Greek as well as
      Latin should be taught to his scholars, appointing two "Readers" in those
      tongues, whose lectures were to be open to the whole University. When,
      therefore, in 1853 Corpus endowed the new Latin Professorship, it was
      acting in the spirit of its Founder. That spirit, indeed, has animated the
      College throughout its history, for hard work (by no means divorced from
      athletic excellence) is traditional at Corpus. Bishop Foxe's plate and
      crozier are still among the treasures of his Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first illustration shews the exterior of the College. Above the
      gateway a curious piece of sculpture represents "Angels bearing the Host,"
      or Corpus Christi, in a monstrance; on either side is a shield, the one
      engraved with Foxe's arms, the other with those of his see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second picture gives the interior of the Front Quadrangle. It is
      perhaps not too fanciful to suggest that the solidity and simplicity of
      the architecture are in keeping with the characteristics which experience
      has taught us to look for in Corpus men. A touch of variety is given by
      the ancient cylindrical dial, constructed in 1581 by Sir Charles Turnbull,
      a Fellow. It is surmounted by the effigy of a pelican, a bird dear to
      Corpus. Another stone pelican, by the way, broods over the Library roof at
      Wadham.

      Yet Wolsey had a public as well as a private ambition. He loved learning,
      and desired to promote it: he sought to save the Church by rearing
      instructed ministers for her service. If he failed, it was a noble
      failure; for though Henry VIII., who now assumed the title of Founder,
      sanctioned an establishment less wide and generous than Wolsey proposed,
      even so the new College easily surpassed all others in the scale of its
      endowments.

      The finest view of Christ Church from without is that which is obtained
      from St. Aldates Street, and is shewn in Mr. Matthison's first drawing.
      "Tom" Tower, which forms the centre of the façade, was not part of the
      original scheme, but was added in 1682, when Dr. John Fell was Dean. The
      College owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Fell for employing Wren as his
      architect, if for nothing else. Wolseys gate, which was no higher than the
      two smaller towers between which his statue stands, might easily have been
      spoilt by a less skilful designer, but Wren added to its beauty, and made
      it one of the finest structures in Oxford. The Tower is named after the
      great bell which it contains, brought from Osney Abbey. Every night "Tom"
      tolls a curfew of a hundred and one strokes at nine o'clock, and at the
      closing stroke all College gates are shut and all undergraduates supposed
      to be within their College walls. Dr. John Fell, by the way, is the Dr.
      Fell whom the epigrammatist disliked without being able to assign a cause.
      His pictures shew a forbidding countenance enough, but he deserved well of
      his College and the University. In addition to the Tower, he completed the
      front towards St. Aldates, fostered the University Press, and did his best
      to make examinations a reality. He planted also the elms of the Broad
      Walk, a beautiful avenue which custom has decreed as the regulation
      promenade on "Show Sunday" (in Commemoration Week); but within the last
      twenty years storms have made havoc of the trees, and little of the Walk's
      former beauty remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Quadrangle&mdash;"Tom Quad." in Oxford parlance&mdash;dwarfs by
      its large dimensions all the other courts of Oxford. The arches and
      rib-mouldings indicate the original intention of the first builders, which
      was to surround the Quadrangle with a cloister. As it is, though this
      design was never carried out, the impression conveyed is one of great
      splendour. Never is the appearance of "Tom Quad." more effective than at
      the moment when the white-robed congregation comes out of the Cathedral
      doors. All undergraduates of "The House" wear surplices&mdash;worn by
      scholars only, save here and at Keble&mdash;and the Cathedral is their
      Chapel. Mr. Matthison has chosen such a moment for his drawing, when the
      Quadrangle is in a moment flooded by the white surplices, varied here and
      there by the crimson hood of a Master or a Doctor's scarlet robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left of the drawing appears the Cathedral spire; in the centre the
      Belfry Tower, a solid and handsome structure put up in Dean Liddell's day;
      and on the right the windows and pinnacles of the Hall.

      To approach the Hall one passes through the archway at the south-east
      corner of the Quadrangle, and ascends a wide staircase notable for the
      wonderful fanwork tracery of the ceiling. This tracery dates from the time
      of Dean Samuel Fell (father of Dr. John Fell), and was completed in 1640;
      it appears in Mr. Matthison's fourth drawing. The Hall itself (which is
      the subject of the next illustration) has no rival in Oxford and no
      superior in England, Westminster Hall only excepted. It measures 115 feet
      by 40, and is 50 feet in height. The window above the dais contains full
      length stained-glass representations of Wolsey, More, Erasmus, Colet, and
      other great men of the Reformation era; and the walls are hung with a very
      fine collection of portraits, including those of Henry VIII. and Wolsey
      (by Holbein), Deans Aldrich and Atterbury (by Kneller), Charles Wesley (by
      Romney), George Canning (by Lawrence), Gladstone (by Millais), "Lewis
      Carroll" (by Herkomer), and Dean Liddell (by Watts).

      There is still much of Christ Church to explore, as the remaining
      illustrations indicate. From Merton Street one approaches "The House" by
      Canterbury Gate, which opens upon the small Canterbury Quadrangle (erected
      towards the end of the eighteenth century). Beyond is Peckwater
      Quadrangle, built in 1705 after the Italian model, on the site of
      Peckwater's Inn. The black and crumbling walls of this quadrangle are in
      striking contrast to the smooth surface of "Tom Quad.," but in the summer
      term, when every window is gay with flowers, the gloom of Peckwater is
      forgotten. On the right hand is the Library, which, beside books, contains
      an interesting collection of paintings of the early Italian schools. The
      outlook from the Meadow Buildings (1863), which includes the Broad Walk,
      the Long Walk, and glimpses of the River, is a pleasant one, though the
      buildings themselves are not, from the outside, particularly attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the famous sons of Christ Church have already been incidentally
      mentioned. As might be expected from its numerous muster-roll, it has had
      members who attained distinction in every walk of life; but statistics
      seem to shew that there is something in the atmosphere of "The House"
      peculiarly favourable to the growth of statesmen. No other College, at any
      rate, has given England three premiers in succession, Mr. Gladstone (a
      double first), Lord Salisbury, and Lord Rosebery. To make an exhaustive
      list might weary the reader, but the honoured name of Sir Robert Peel must
      at least be mentioned. Strenuous as were these men's labours in
      after-life, it is permissible to fancy that amid the pleasant surroundings
      of their student days they did not altogether "scorn delights." Here, for
      instance, is an extract from the diary kept by Charles Wesley when an
      undergraduate: "Wrote to V.&mdash;translated&mdash;played an hour at
      billiards." There is no harm in supposing "V." a girl, if we choose.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

    <p>
      Again, the expounding of mathematics term after term is a sober pursuit
      enough, yet C. L. Dodgson, mathematical tutor of Christ Church, had
      leisure to be "Lewis Carroll" also, the nursery classic, the delight of
      children of all ages. The serious purpose of John Ruskin, who as the
      anonymous "Oxford Graduate" took the Art world by storm, could not
      extinguish his lambent humour. It is a part of the genius of Christ Church
      to keep alive a certain sunshine of the mind. Let us hope that this was
      the case even with her austerer thinkers; with Locke, who was forced to
      leave the College on account of his Whig opinions; with William Penn, who
      was sent down for nonconformity&mdash;you will find sunshine as well as
      shadow in his little volume, <i>Some Fruits of Solitude</i>, which he is
      thought to have composed, partly at any rate, in prison; and with Dr.
      Pusey, as he searched for the way of perfection among the dusty folios of
      patristic lore.

    <h2>
      TRINITY COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>RINITY COLLEGE was
      founded by Sir Thomas Pope, a rich lawyer, in 1555. The site was
      previously occupied by Durham College, a now extinct foundation, which
      existed for the training of students from the Benedictine monastery of
      Durham.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much that is admirable about the buildings and grounds of
      Trinity; and its position is so little secluded that anyone passing down
      Broad Street or Parks Road can hardly help noticing its beauties. The
      first illustration shews the College as seen from Broad Street. In the
      foreground are the handsome wrought-iron gates&mdash;there is a companion
      pair at the verge of the garden, in Parks Road&mdash;beyond which is the
      square Entrance Tower leading to the Small Quadrangle, decorated by four
      figures representing Astronomy, Geometry, Divinity, and Medicine. The old
      cottage buildings on the right of the Porter's Lodge, facing Broad Street,
      which are now used as College rooms, are in striking contrast with the new
      buildings designed by Mr. T. G. Jackson, R.A., and finished in 1887; these
      are some of the last century's most successful additions to ancient
      Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chapel has an unwonted fragrance, for the wainscot is of cedar; it is
      famous also for its carving, being in this particular one of the best
      examples of the work of Grinling Gibbons. The Hall has an unusually good
      collection of portraits. Of all the buildings the Buttery is probably the
      most ancient.

      The second illustration, taken from Parks Road, shews a part of the
      garden, with the Inner Quadrangle in the background; this latter is built
      in the Italian manner, after Wren's design. The costume of the loiterers
      in the garden, of both sexes, suggests that Mr. Matthison painted his
      picture on some warm day of spring. On such a day it is pleasant to fleet
      the time carelessly amid such scenes as these; nor must the beautiful Lime
      Tree Walk escape mention, whose pleached boughs form a continuous archway
      of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trinity can point to a remarkably long list of distinguished members, of
      whom it may suffice to name here the poets Lodge and Denham, Harrington
      (author of <i>Oceana</i>), Chatham, Professor Freeman, Bishop Stubbs, and
      Richard Burton. But Burtons stay was a short one; he heard already "the
      call of the wild."

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>RCHBISHOP
      CHICHELE'S College of St. Bernard, established by him in 1437 and
      suppressed by Henry VIII., occupied the site of what is now St. John's
      College. One reminder of the older foundation is the statue of St.
      Bernard, which still stands in the Tower over the Gateway. This Gateway,
      sketched from St. Giles', forms the subject of the second illustration.
      The Hall and Chapel too, though much altered in later times, were in the
      first instance used by the Cistercians.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. John's was founded by Sir Thomas White, Lord Mayor of London, in 1555.
      His portrait hangs in the Hall, as well as those of Laud and Juxon,
      successively Presidents of the College and Archbishops of Canterbury, and
      that of George III. St. John's was devoted to the Stuart cause, so it may
      be supposed that the likeness of the Hanoverian king was not hung without
      compunctions on the part of senior members. The Library contains a
      portrait of Charles I., and statues of him and of his queen face each
      other in the Inner Quadrangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reference has been already made to the second illustration. The first
      shews the exterior of the Front Quadrangle, sketched from within the
      walled row of elm trees. This Quadrangle was only finished in 1597, when
      its eastern side (facing the Gateway) was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inner Quadrangle, which was begun at the same date and completed in
      the first half of the seventeenth century, is, from an architectural point
      of view, of unusual interest. The visitor may naturally inquire what two
      classical colonnades are doing in a Gothic quadrangle. There is no more
      satisfactory reply than that the architect, Inigo Jones, made a somewhat
      bold experiment, combining Italian reminiscences with a Gothic scheme.
      Individual taste may determine how far he was successful; probably most
      critics will admire the colonnades in themselves, but think them out of
      place where they are. Laud furnished the funds for Inigo Jones' work, but
      happily the pair excluded the Italian element from their Garden Front,
      which is certainly one of the most beautiful things in Oxford. Diverse as
      are the judgments which have been passed upon Laud's character and
      actions, there cannot be two opinions as to the beauty and fitness of this
      building, nor could any Head of a College desire a worthier memorial.
      Coming up to St. John's as a scholar in 1590, Laud became President in
      1611, and on the completion of his new buildings had the honour of
      receiving King Charles I. and Queen Henrietta Maria as his guests. Full of
      stress as his life was, and tragic as was its end, his most peaceful hours
      were probably passed within the walls of the Foundation which his
      generosity did so much to adorn. His body, which had been buried in London
      after his execution, was brought to St. John's at the Restoration, and
      laid to rest, as he had desired, beneath the altar in the Chapel. The
      Library contains a valuable collection of ecclesiastical vestments which
      are said to be his gift.

      The third and fourth illustrations shew the north and south ends of the
      Garden Front. The open window in Mrs. Waltons sketch is that of the room
      occupied by Laud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Garden is among the most delightful in Oxford; and for beauty and
      diversity of flowers it certainly bears the palm. Like the garden at
      Wadham, it was formerly laid out in the stiff Dutch style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas White, the Founder, was a member of the Guild of Merchant

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ESUS COLLEGE since
      its birth in 1571 has always been closely connected with Wales. Queen
      Elizabeth, who did not forget her Welsh ancestry, and "took no scorn,"
      perhaps, "to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day," was willing to accept
      from Hugh Price, its actual originator, the honorary title of Founder. The
      College possesses three portraits of this sovereign, as well as pictures
      of Charles I. and Charles II. (who were benefactors).
    </p>
    <p>
      The buildings are in the late Gothic style. The two illustrations shew
      different aspects of the Front Quadrangle, which conveys an impression of
      beauty and restfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chapel is interesting. Above the entrance is a Latin inscription,
      signifying "May prayer ascend, may grace descend." Within are the tombs of
      Dr. Henry Maurice, Professor of Divinity, 1691; Sir Edward Stradling, a
      colonel in Charles I.'s army, 1644; and several Principals of the College:&mdash;Dr.
      Francis Mansell, who held that office three times; Sir Eubule Thelwall,
      Principal from 1621 to 1630; and Sir Leoline Jenkins, appointed in 1661.
      First appointed in 1620, Dr. Mansell resigned the following year in favour
      of Thelwall, who had completed the building of the College. His second
      term of office was cut short in Commonwealth days, but he was reinstated
      at the Restoration; the only Head of a College, perhaps, who underwent
      such repeated vicissitudes. Sir Leoline Jenkins did much to repair the
      damages which the College suffered in the Civil Wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service in the Chapel on Wednesday and Friday evenings is entirely in
      the Welsh language.

    <p>
      Distinguished members in the past of Jesus College were Henry Vaughan, the
      poet; "Beau Nash," the arbiter of fashion in Bath; Lloyd of St. Asaph, one
      of "the Seven Bishops"; and J. R. Green, the historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were Sir Hugh Evans and Fluellen, those embodiments of Welsh humours,
      suggested by Jesus men? We may think so, if we will; for Shakespeare is
      known to have visited Oxford, and is quite as likely to have picked up his
      Welshmen there as anywhere else.

    <h2>
      WADHAM COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T can only be
      conjectured how long the vision of a stately building which, like
      Absalom's Pillar, should preserve the memory of his childless house,
      haunted the vacant hours of Nicholas Wadham of Merifield, in the county of
      Somerset. What is certain is that death cut short his day-dreams, and that
      he committed the accomplishment of his design to his wife Dorothy. This
      remarkable woman was seventy-five years of age when the task devolved upon
      her. She assumed its responsibilities to such good purpose that within
      three years the College which bears her name was completed. The members of
      the first Foundation were admitted in 1613, and the Foundress lived some
      five years more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wadham is one of the most perfect specimens of late Gothic architecture in
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No alteration whatever has taken place in the Front Quadrangle since its
      erection; only, where the stones have crumbled, they have been cunningly
      replaced. The Chapel, though Perpendicular, was erected at the same time
      as the other buildings. The late Mr. J. H. Parker made the reasonable
      suggestion that the architect desired to emphasise by this variation of
      style the religious and secular uses of the several structures. Wadham,
      whether viewed from Parks Road or from its own delightful gardens, is a
      veritable joy to the beholder, as our illustrations indicate. The Hall,
      moreover, which is one of the finest in Oxford and contains a large
      collection of portraits, should not be neglected, nor the interior of the
      Chapel, with the sombre grandeur of its stained windows and "prophets
      blazoned on the panes."

      Wadham's early prosperity received a check in Civil War times, when its
      plate was melted down for the king and its Warden driven out by the
      Roundheads. Yet Wilkins, its new Warden, did not abuse his trust; and,
      thanks to his interest in science, it was within the walls of this College
      that the idea of the Royal Society was conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wadham has not lacked famous members, of diverse professions and highly
      divergent opinions. There is Admiral Blake, whose statue watches to-day
      over his native Bridgewater; Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, who was made
      Master of Arts at fourteen; Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons; Lord
      Westbury, whose inscription in the ante-chapel tells us that he "dated all
      his success in life from the time when he was elected a scholar of Wadham
      at the age of fifteen"; Dean Church among ecclesiastics and Dr. Congreve
      among Positivists. Finally, there is Sir Christopher Wren, whose name has
      been kept to the end in order that there may be coupled with it the name
      of Mr. T. G. Jackson, R.A.; for these two architects, both sons of Wadham,
      have left impressions which deserve to be indelible upon the Oxford that
      we know.

    <h2>
      PEMBROKE COLLEGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>EMBROKE dates its
      collegiate life from 1624, but it had already existed and flourished for
      several centuries as Broadgates Hall. It owed its rise in the world to the
      benefactions of Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwick, burgesses of
      Abingdon, who desired to endow a College for the benefit of their native
      town, and its new name to the Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of Oxford.
      Thomas Browne, who was later to be the author of <i>Religio Medici</i>,
      being senior commoner of the Hall at this epoch, delivered a Latin oration
      at the opening ceremony, in which he did not fail to employ the metaphor
      of the Phoenix rising out of its ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Architecturally, Pembroke is a little put out of countenance by the
      neighbouring glories of Christ Church; nevertheless, the interior of the
      Inner Quadrangle ("The Grass Quad.," as it is called), which is the
      subject of the first illustration, possesses an irregular but restful
      beauty. Up and down its staircases trod George Whitefield, who, as a
      servitor, had the ungrateful duty of seeing that the students were in
      their rooms at a fixed hour; yet not one syllable of discontent with so
      humble a vocation disfigures the pages of his diary.

      On the right hand, as one enters the Front Quadrangle, is the library,
      formerly the refectory of Broadgates Hall, and the only surviving part of
      that institution. The Chapel, renovated and decorated by Mr. C. E. Kempe
      in 1884, should be visited. The view of the gateway possesses an added
      interest from the fact that Samuel Johnson, when an undergraduate of
      Pembroke, lodged in a room in the second storey over the entrance. Johnson
      ever retained an affection for his University and College, but it is to be
      feared that during his residence of fourteen months poverty and ill-health
      combined to make him far from happy. To others, perhaps, he appeared 'gay
      and frolicsome,' bent on entertaining his companions and keeping them from
      their studies, but to Boswell he gave a different explanation. 'Ah, Sir,'
      he said, 'I was mad and violent. It was bitterness which they mistook for
      frolic. I was miserably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my
      literature and my wit, so I disregarded all power and all authority.' In a
      more cheerful mood he spoke of Pembroke as 'a nest of singing birds'; and
      it is on record that he cut lectures to go sliding on Christ Church
      Meadow. Dr. Johnson is Pembroke's most famous son; but she can also point
      to the names of Francis Beaumont, John Pym, Shenstone, Blackstone, and
      Birkbeck Hill, Boswell's greatest editor.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ORCESTER COLLEGE
      is the successor to Gloucester Hall, a hostel of the Benedictine Order
      founded in the thirteenth century. This Hall was originally designed for
      students from the monastery at Gloucester, but was soon thrown open to
      other Benedictine houses. Suppressed at the Reformation, it was called
      back to life in Elizabeth's reign by Sir Thomas White, who had already
      shewn his zeal for education by founding St. John's College, and for
      several generations had a successful career. Among its distinguished
      members may be mentioned Thomas Allen, mathematician; Sir Kenelm Digby,
      the romantic wooer of the brilliant and high-spirited Venetia Stanley; and
      Richard Lovelace, the Cavalier poet. At the Restoration bad times came,
      and Gloucester Hall, like the earlier Hertford College of a subsequent
      age, seemed likely to perish of inanition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis there stepped in a benefactor, Sir Thomas Crookes of
      Worcestershire, with a bequest of £10,000; and the transformed Hall was
      known, from 1698 onwards, as Worcester College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worcester is comparatively at some distance from the other Colleges, a
      fact on which undergraduate humour loves to dwell; but jests on this
      subject reflect rather on the poor walking powers of those who make them.
      At any rate, a "well-girt" visitor to Oxford need not hesitate to take the
      journey, and will certainly find his pains rewarded, for Worcester has
      much to show that is of interest, and much that is beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first view gives the interior of the Front Quadrangle. The buildings
      here are stately and dignified, if a little cold; they are obviously of
      the same date as those overlooking the deer-park of Magdalen, and suggest
      the genius of the eighteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could hardly be a greater contrast to these than the ancient
      structures which are at the left hand of the Quadrangle, as one enters;
      for these old buildings take us back to the monastic days of Gloucester
      Hall. A glimpse of them, as viewed from the Garden, is given in the second
      illustration.

      The Garden itself is delightful, and has, alone of Oxford pleasances, the
      additional feature of a lake. Mr. Matthison's drawing shows how beautiful
      this lake and its surroundings can be, when the colours are newly laid on
      by the brush of summer.

      Quadrangle, opposite the gateway. One view gives the interior of the
      Quadrangle&mdash;in which is a sloping stairway reminiscent of a larger
      one of the same type in Blois Castle, the other shews the College from
      without, and includes the new buildings recently finished.

      So far back as the thirteenth century it was in existence as Hart Hall;
      and here the students of Exeter and New College were successively lodged,
      while their own Colleges were building. Rightly or wrongly, Exeter College
      claimed the ownership of Hart Hall for four centuries; but in 1740 the
      then Principal of the Hall, Dr. Newton, was successful in asserting its
      independence, and Hart Hall became Hertford College. The endowments,
      however, were insignificant; the members fell off and the walls (or a part
      of them) fell down; and in 1820 a commission declared that Hertford
      College no longer existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Magdalen Hall, which stood close to Magdalen College, was
      burned down, and the University allotted the buildings of Hertford to its
      roofless inhabitants; and the name of Hertford was changed to Magdalen
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final transformation came in 1874, when Hertford College, its title
      revived by Act of Parliament, was endowed by Mr. Baring, the banker. Thus,
      with finances very different to the slender endowments of Dr. Newton's
      time, the College began a new era of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous Selden was at Hart Hall, and Charles James Fox at Hertford; the
      old Magdalen Hall bred William Tyndale, Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Clarendon,
      and Thomas Hobbes, author of <i>Leviathan</i>.

      Another primary purpose of Keble is to provide a less expensive education
      than that afforded by other Colleges. At the moment when the scheme was
      formulated died John Keble, author of the <i>Christian Year</i>, and it was
      decided to name the new foundation after him, at once as a tribute to his
      memory and in order to enlist the active sympathies of his many admirers.
      An appeal for funds met with a liberal and widespread response, and Keble

      The external appearance of Keble is not commonly admired. It is a
      pleasanter task to dwell for a moment on the beauty of the interior of the
      Chapel, which was presented by Mr. William Gibbs, and completed in 1876.
      The visitor will be struck by the noble proportions of this edifice, its
      finely toned windows and its elaborate mosaics. A small ante-chapel
      contains Holman Hunt's celebrated picture&mdash;The Light of the World,
      presented by Mrs. Combe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keble soon took its place among the other Colleges, both in work and play.
      It has a splendid Hall and Library, given by the Gibbs family. In
      accordance with the economy of the scheme, the rooms of the undergraduates
      are small, and all meals are taken in common in Hall. There is
      consequently more of the air of a public school about Keble than is looked
      for in ordinary College life. Its first warden, Dr. Talbot, is now Bishop
      of Southwark.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
